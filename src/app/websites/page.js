              Features Angular front-end, Springboot back-end, MySQL Database, search functionality, 
              pagination, catalogue categories, data validation, field auto-fill, and ordering functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was a massive project for me and has a lot of bells and whistles.

              The search bar and categories on the sidebar both filter the database to only show 
              relavent material. If there is nothing matching the search bar or if the back-end is not online 
              the screen will show no items and display a message saying nothing is available.

              After adding a few items to cart, you can click the cart button in the upper right. This will take you to your 
              cart screen and show off all the items and prices. The price and item count next to the cart update whenever 
              an item is added. Easy access buttons are available for cart items to increase/decrease quantity and 
              even remove the item entirely.

              Checking out takes you to... *drumroll*... the checkout screen. Amazing. The picture doesn't 
              show it all, but you fill in your information here in dropdown boxes and fields. Most of them have 
              at least a little bit of input validation such as making sure that only numbers are used where 
              appropriate. The expiration field even auto sets to the most recent month/year and can't be changed 
              to anything earlier. There's also functionality to match the shipping address and billing address 
              to prevent the need of typing it all again.

              If you attempt to click purchase without filling in the required fields, the website 
              will prevent you from moving on.

                After filling in everything correctly, an order is created with a unique order number

            <h2>Hotel Reservation FullStack</h2>
            <p>Features multithreading and a dockerfile.</p>
            <p>
              This website is for reserving a room at a fictional hotel. This site contains an ad for 
              a live presentation which has date/time conversion based on timezones. 
              At the top of the page is a few very out of place lines that are 
              purely to show that multithreading is working. 
            </p>
            <div className="flex gap-16 justify-center">

            <p>
              You select a start date and an end 
              date and any rooms available in that time are shown. Any of these rooms can be reserved, and if 
              they are, they will not show up as available during that time anymore. The price is displayed 
              in multiple different currencies by utilizing pipes to convert them (doesn't covert the 
              actual price, just adds the correct symbol).
